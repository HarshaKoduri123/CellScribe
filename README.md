#  CellScribe  
**A Multimodal Single-Cell Representation and Reasoning Framework**  
*Inspired from CellWhisperer*

---

## Overview
**CellScribe** is a research-oriented framework for **multimodal single-cell representation learning and biological reasoning**, inspired by the ideas introduced in **CellWhisperer**.  
The project investigates how **single-cell transcriptomics**, **cell metadata**, and **language-based representations** can be integrated to enable interpretable and flexible cellular analysis.
